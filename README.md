### `npm run cy:run`

The "cy:run" command is used to run end-to-end tests using Cypress. Cypress is a popular testing framework that enables

To use this command, simply run npm run cy:run in your terminal. This will start the tests and output the results to the
terminal. If any of the tests fail, Cypress will provide detailed error messages to help you diagnose the issue.
